# Sunsetting TillWhen

As of _**2nd July 2023**_, TillWhen will not allow any more signup requests. You
will still be able to login if you already had an account but there will be no
more new account creation.

An alert for the same will be visible on the dashboard to notify users of this,
so they can move to a different service as needed.

As always, your tasks / logs will be deleted permanently when we do shut the
site down. The app will be available to use for the next month and would be shut
down altogether on _**3rd August,2023**_.

If you wish to know more about the personal details of the shutdown, you can
read about it on https://reaper.is/writing/shutting-down-tillwhen
