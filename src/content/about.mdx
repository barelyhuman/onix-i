# About

The original reason for this app was to help the company I work for,
[Fountane LLC](https://fountane.com).

It served it's original purpose well, we don't use time tracking anymore so the
tool is being maintained as a free service for other people that started using
it during that time.

**I don't intend to earn money** from the app considering the userbase is pretty
small and the only charges I'm paying for right now are that for the server
which again is pretty cheap since the userbase is **tiny** and I don't need a
huge server to handle that.

## Human Run Product

There's no big company sponsoring or investing here, it's all run by
me([reaper](https://reaper.is)) and for any feedback or help that you need, the
person you'll be getting in touch with is going to be me.

## Privacy and Data

There is **no use** for your data for me, the only information the app takes
from you is your name which could be set to anything, I couldn't care less.

Also, too lazy to sit and track who's doing what so there's no analytics on the
platform either.

at the end of the day, **its just a time tracker** and a pretty verbose one to
be fair.

You can read more about that on the [Privacy Policy](/legal/privacy-policy)

## Getting In Touch / Feedback

It's fairly easy, just shoot an email with your concern on
[ahoy@barelyhuman.dev](mailto:ahoy@barelyhuman.dev) and I'll get back as soon as
I can.
